# Dash Online Data Science Dashboard using Plotly

## A Python project to analyse Facebook Stock Market performance and it's key metrics

In this project I created an online dashboard (which can at the moment be tested using a local server) to interactively analyse and visualize two different datasets. <br>

The first dataset is about stock prices. In this Dashboard, I an fact compare Facebook stock market performances with other companies such as Tesla, Microsoft and Apple. This dataset is available to download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs/downloads/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs.zip/3). <br>

The second dataset used to analyse Facebook Performance Metrics (eg. likes per post, paid vs free posts distributions), is instead available [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0148296316000813?via%3Dihub). <br>

This project is still in progress, and I am planning to add more functionalities and designs to the final dashboard. Finally, this Dashboard is going to be deployed online on my personal website so that to be available to everyone.
